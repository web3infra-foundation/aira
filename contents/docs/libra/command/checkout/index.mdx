title: The [checkout] Command
description: Check out and switch to a local or remote branches
---

### Usage

libra switch [OPTIONS] [BRANCH]

### Arguments

-   `[BRANCH]` - Target branche name

### Description

Switch to a specified branch. If the local branch does not exist, but there is a remote branch with the same name, download that branch and set the remote one as the upstream.
For example:

```shell
$ libra branch -l && $libra branch -r
* main
  origin/develop_branch9
  origin/main

$ libra checkout develop_branch9 
branch 'develop_branch9' set up to track 'origin/develop_branch9'.
...
Switched to a new branch 'develop_branch9'
...

$ libra checkout
Current branch is develop_branch9.
```

The working tree and index will be updated to match the branch. You should make sure your working tree is clean before switching branches. Otherwise, the operation will be aborted.

### Options

-   `-b`
    Create and switch to a new branch with the same content as the current branch.

<Note type="note" title="Note">
The checkout command currently only supports the "-b" option. Some differences between it and Git are:

1. If the current branch has an upstream branch, Git can obtain and determine the synchronization status of the two branches. Libra cannot do this currently.

2. Git does not need to clean up the index and working tree before switching branches, but Libra does.
