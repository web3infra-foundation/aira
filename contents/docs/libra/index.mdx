Libra is a partial implementation of a Git client, developed using Rust. Our goal is not to create a 100% replica of Git (for those interested in such a project, please refer to the gitoxide). Instead, libra focus on implementing the basic functionalities of Git for learning Git and Rust. A key feature of libra is the replacement of the original Git internal storage architecture with SQLite.
