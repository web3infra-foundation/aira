### Unit Tests

Unit tests are small, focused tests that verify the behavior of a single function or module in isolation.

#### Example:

```rust
// ...Other Codes

#[cfg(test)] // indicates this block will only be compiled when running tests
mod tests {
   use super::*;

   #[test] // indicates that this function is a test, which will be run by `cargo test`
   fn test_add() {
      let result = add(1, 1);
      assert_eq!(result, 2); // assert is important to tests
   }
}
```

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different parts of your **library** work correctly together.
They are **external** to your crate and use your code in the same way any other code would.

#### Steps
You can refer to the implementation of the mega **module**. ([mega/tests](/mega/tests))
1. Create a `tests` directory at the **same level** as your `src` directory (e.g. `libra/tests`).
2. Add `*.rs` files in this directory. // Each file will be compiled as a separate **crate**.

#### Attention
- The `tests` in **root** directory (workspace) is NOT integration tests, but some `data` for other tests.
- If you need a common module, use `tests/common/mod.rs` rather than `tests/common.rs`, to declare it's not a test file.
- There is no need to add `#[cfg(test)]` to the `tests` directory. `tests` will be compiled only when running tests.

#### Run integration tests
The following command will be executed in `GitHub Actions`.

This command DOES NOT run **Unit Tests** (which could be very messy).
```bash
cargo test --workspace --test '*' -- --nocapture
```
- `--workspace` : Run tests for **all packages** in the workspace.
- `--test` : Test the specified **integration test**.
- `--` : Pass the following arguments to the test binary.
- `--nocapture` : DO NOT capture the output (e.g. `println!`) of the test.

If you want to run tests in a specific package, you can use `--package`.

For more information, please refer to the [rust wiki](https://rustwiki.org/zh-CN/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html).
